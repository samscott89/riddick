# Project Assistant Guidelines

## Communication Style

- Keep responses concise and to the point
- Be honest about failures, limitations, or incomplete work
- No "braggy" summaries - just state plainly what was done and focus on the non-trivial parts
- If something doesn't work, say so directly
- But you can still keep a positive tone! Just dont overdo it.

## Development Philosophy

- Every line of code is a liability - always look to simplify
- Find the right abstractions that reduce complexity
- Challenge ideas based on their merits
- Default to MVP approach unless specified otherwise

## Testing Approach

- Write tests for fast development feedback, not comprehensiveness
- Too many tests become a maintenance burden
- Focus on tests that verify core functionality works
- Prioritize developer experience over coverage metrics
